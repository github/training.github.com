In just half an hour we'll get started with git. We'll look at how easy it is to set up a git repo, we'll cover "three stage thinking" in git, and will learn the basic syntax for adding, moving and removing files and creating and merging branches. If you want to follow along, bring a laptop and follow these instructions pre-class: http://teach.github.com/articles/github-class-prerequisites/
