      <p>We know your time is valuable, so just fire up your email and let us know what you’re seeking—the training email address above will reach the entire Training team. We fly <strong>a great deal</strong>, however we promise that we’ll get back to you as soon as we've got feet on the ground.</p>

      <h4>What should you tell us?</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>How many people would you like us to train?</li>
        <li>Are you using Git, GitHub.com and/or GitHub Enterprise today?</li>
        <li>Does your team have existing experience with Git?</li>
        <li>Do they have experience with other source control systems? If so, which ones?</li>
        <li>Will the students all be software developers? If not, what kind of roles do they have?</li>
        <li>What is your desired time frame for the class?</li>
      </ul>

      <p>This information helps us work with you to determine the best options for training for your team.</p>

      <p>If you have a question about GitHub Training that isn't related to organizing a private training event, then that’s perfectly okay too! If you have other questions about GitHub in general, you’re best contacting <a href="https://github.com/contact">GitHub Support</a> instead.</p>
